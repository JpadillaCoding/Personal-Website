            Major milestones through my developer journey. I've started as a

              Dabbled with HTML and CSS in Highschool. I did some after achool
              activies to learn. Although MySpace was phased out, I still used
              it to practicec HTML and CSS.

              I played around with free resources. FreeCodeCamp and mobile apps
              that taught a bit of javascript. Unfortunately, covid hit and life
              took my attention away from programming.

            <p>
              I remembered really enjoying programming from my past exposure. At
              this point I'm already established in my career as a process
              technician, but I want to start doing something I really enjoy. I
              started solidifying my knowledge with more FreeCodeCamp courses-
              Responsive web design, Javascript, Algorithms and Data structures.

            <h2>More Rigor With Harvard's CS50</h2>
            <p>
              Online reccomendations pointed to trying out Harvards CS50 since
              it taught fundamentals. I decided to try it out and see if
              programming could be an enjoyable career change. Lessons were
              taught in C to teach students what's going in behind the scenes of
              modern languages. In the end this solidified my journey and I
              started looking into my options to formalize my learning.

              Took a part time course in Software Engineering. I worked full
              time at 48/hrs per week while juggling the 30/hr a week course for
              6 months. The intense schedule was worth it, as every week that I
              learned somethng new and got to solve problems was pure
              satisfaction. My proudest moment in this course was being voted
              most likely to solve a difficult problem by the class and voted
              most likely to retire in costa rica by our lead instructor. Cheesy
              stuff, but it feels nice knowing those hours of picking at the tid
              bit information was paying off.

              Hack For LA has been a wonderful opportunity to develop
              collaboration skills, learning bets practice, and growing as a
              developer. I've learned a lot through participating in meetings,
              getting pull request reviews, and reviewing pull request. Added
              new features to the website and even got to try out opitimizing
              their GitHub workflow by automating a part of the issue system on
              the project board.

              Made a mobile app from scratch using React Native. The app was
              made for a forum that had a need of analyzing ingredients in hair
              products. I got 100+ downloads and along with the opportunity to
              learn Google Cloud Services, solidified my FrontEnd and BackEnd
              skills.

              Noticed that a technology in demand is Typescript, so I joined the

              skills up to date. I joined this project during its development
              phase and have gotten to contribute from scratch.
