            My name is Jose Padilla. I'm a Software Engineer in Houston,
            Texas. Programming is a true enjoyment of mine since it accommodates
            my need of solving problems. Currently, I am sharpening my skills
            with projects and volunteering as a Software Engineer at Hack For
            LA.
